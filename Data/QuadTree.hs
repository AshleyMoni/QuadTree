---- Functor:

onQuads fn tree = tree {wrappedQuad = fn (wrappedQuad tree)}

-- |Cleanup function for use after any 'Prelude.fmap'.
--
-- When elements of a 'QuadTree' are modified by the 'atLocation'
-- lens, it automatically compresses identical adjacent nodes into
-- larger ones. This keeps the 'QuadTree' from bloating over constant
-- use.
--
-- 'Prelude.fmap' does not do this. If you wish to treat the
-- 'QuadTree' as a 'Prelude.Functor', you should compose this function
-- after to collapse it down to its minimum size.

-- 'fuseTree' . 'Prelude.fmap' fn tree

---- Foldable:

-- $tiles
-- Directly folding a 'QuadTree' will expand it into a sequence of
-- elements that are then folded over. For some types of operations
-- this can be incredibly inefficient; it may be faster to simply
-- manipulate a sequence of leaves and then later decompose the
-- results into a list of elements.
--
-- For these operations, we can use 'Tile's. 'Tile's are simply
-- blocks of elements, represented by a tuple of the leaf data and
-- some information on the spatial location and dimensions of the
-- block.

-- |Rectangular area, represented by a tuple of four Ints.
--
-- They correspond to (X floor, Y floor, X ceiling, Y ceiling).
--
-- The co-ordinates are inclusive of all the rows and columns in all
-- four Ints.

-- prop> regionArea (x, y, x, y) == 1

                                            treeWidth  tree - 1)

regionIntersection :: Region -> Region -> Region
regionIntersection (xl , yt , xr , yb )
                   (xl', yt', xr', yb') =

-- |Simple helper function that lets you calculate the area of a

---- Foldable extras:

---- Sample Printers:

-- |Generates a newline delimited string representing a 'QuadTree' as
-- a 2D block of characters.

-- is simply a mnemonic for its @'QuadTree' -> String@ behaviour.

-- |As 'showTree' above, but also prints it.
